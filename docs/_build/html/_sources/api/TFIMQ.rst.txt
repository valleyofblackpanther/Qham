create_tfim_circuit function
============================

.. function:: create_tfim_circuit(n_qubits, theta_z, theta_x, periodic_boundary=False)

   Constructs a quantum circuit that simulates the Transverse Field Ising Model (TFIM) on a chain of qubits. The circuit includes ZZ interactions and transverse field applications, with an option for periodic boundary conditions.

   :param n_qubits: The number of qubits, representing spins in the TFIM chain.
   :type n_qubits: int
   :param theta_z: The angle parameter for the ZZ interaction gates (RZ rotations).
   :type theta_z: float
   :param theta_x: The angle parameter for the RX transverse field gates.
   :type theta_x: float
   :param periodic_boundary: Flag to determine whether to apply periodic boundary conditions, connecting the last qubit to the first.
   :type periodic_boundary: bool, optional
   :returns: The quantum circuit representing the TFIM simulation.
   :rtype: QuantumCircuit

   This function uses the Qiskit library to create a circuit with controlled-X (CX) and rotation gates (RZ, RX) to represent the interactions in the TFIM. It supports the application of periodic boundary conditions to model a closed spin chain.

Example Usage
-------------

The following example demonstrates the creation of a TFIM circuit for 4 qubits with specified theta parameters and periodic boundary conditions:

.. code-block:: python

   # Define the number of qubits and interaction parameters
   n_qubits = 4
   theta_z = 1.0  # ZZ interaction strength
   theta_x = 1.5  # Transverse field strength
   
   # Create the TFIM circuit with periodic boundary conditions
   qc = create_tfim_circuit(n_qubits, theta_z, theta_x, periodic_boundary=True)
   
   # Print the circuit for inspection
   print(qc)

This script will output a quantum circuit for the TFIM model that includes periodic boundary conditions.
