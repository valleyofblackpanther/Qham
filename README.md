# Qham - A QUICK INSIGHT INTO QUANTUM HAMILTONIAN SIMULATIONS

Qham is a Python SDK designed to bridge the gap between theoretical physics and practical quantum computing applications. It provides a comprehensive suite of tools for exploring, simulating, and analyzing Hamiltonian processes across statistical mechanics and quantum mechanics.

At the heart of Qham lies a mission to democratize the understanding of Hamiltonian dynamics, unravel the complexities of physical systems, and streamline the development of quantum algorithms. By amalgamating theoretical concepts with practical computational tools, Qham endeavors to make the intricate study of Hamiltonian systems both accessible and intuitive. 


## Overview

Qham is a Python library that consists of the following components:

| Component | Description |
| ---- | --- |
| [**qham**]() | A lightweight Quantum Hamiltonian Simulations for high-performance Quantum research |
| [**qham.fhm**]() | FermiHubbard Modal |
| [**qham.hbm**]() | Heisenberg Modal |
| [**qham.qho**]() | Quantum Harmonic Oscillator |
| [**qham.TFIM**]() | Transverse Field Ising Model |

Qham, can be used for,

- a Hamiltonian processing in quantum mechanics and statistical mechanics.
- a quantum python package whichl will give a good introduction quantum hamilotnian simulations.


# Installation 
See the Qham **[Installation][]** guide for detailed installation instructions (including building from source).

Currently, `qham` supports releases of Python 3.6 onwards; 
To install the current release:

import qham
# Initialize the TFIM simulation
sim = TFIMSimulation(size=10, beta=0.4, h=0.05, steps=100)

# Run the simulation
sim.run_simulation()

# Plot the final lattice configuration
sim.plot_lattice()
```
